				<p>
					In the beginning, there was the meme calendar. T'was but a simple concept that would later grow to be the leader of a revolution. And the meme lords declared, "LET THERE BE MEMES," and so there were. And the meme lords said they were good. They were organized monthly, so that one meme may dominate every month.

					<h2> The Revolution </h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					In the month of October, when spooky times were nigh, there came a great time of peril for all meme users. A great meme drought destroyed their populations as no new memes were being made. This disaster lasted four long hard days and our meme lords were wary of this lack of memes. But then, just as all hope seemed lost, a revolution sparked.
				</p>
				<p>
					The great meme lords drew all their power and declared the meme drought over. They summoned the greatest storm they could bring, and in turn brought the great meme revolution. First it was the Bear in the Big Blue house, but the memes did not end there, no. Every day a new meme grew from the hundreds of seeds sewn in the land that was once riddled with drought. Then the skeletons came - not only the spooky ones, but the king himself - Skeletor. More and more memes were being both created and brought back from the dead, Star Wars, communism, chivalry and ancient seige machines, Bionicles, and of course, Dat Boi.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now there was no longer a meme of the month, but in fact a meme every day. There was no end to the stream of memes, an endless flood of both new and old memes, and even stitched together memes of both new and old.
